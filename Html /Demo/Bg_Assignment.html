  <h1>HTML-(HyperText Markup Language)</h1>
  <p>
    <h2>What is HTML :–</h2><b> TheHyperText Markup Language, or HTML</b> is the standard markup language for documents
    designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and
    scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
    HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.

    <h3>Description :-</h3>
    It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website, so it's crucial to learn if you want to have a career
    in web development.

    In this article, I will walk you through what HTML is about in detail, how it does things on web pages, and we'll
    also touch on a really cool part of HTML – Semantic HTML.
    <br>
    To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:

    Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items

    Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format

    Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.
    <br>
    HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and
    interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add
    interactivity, respectively.

    In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a
    human body.

    HTML is the skeleton,
    CSS is the skin,
    and JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that brings the structure and the skin to
    life.
    You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: HTML is the structure of a house, CSS is the interior and
    exterior decor, and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, and many other functional features that make the
    house livable.
